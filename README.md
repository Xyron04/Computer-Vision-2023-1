# Computer-Vision-2023-1
Repository with the files of the last computer vision homework

The project consists of coding an image classification program for 3 classes of surfaces (decks, walls and pavements). These classes 
have subclasses (cracked or non cracked). The project use Pytorch and a ResNet - 18 pretrained weights to classify the images and reach 
a 87% after the training. 

We recommend to use Google Collab to run the program and try others architectures to improve the results. The database consists 
of nearly 54000 images and you can find the problem and others solutions here:
